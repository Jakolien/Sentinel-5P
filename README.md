Possible issues

As far as I am aware this code works on Python 3.6.4. Potential issues are listed below


1. When doing 'conda install basemap' I found a version conflict so downloaded the windows binary installer https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#basemap … but this one depends on 'VC++ 2015.3 v14', install it following these instructions https://stackoverflow.com/a/50671800/9935639 … and then 'pip install basemap_filepath'
